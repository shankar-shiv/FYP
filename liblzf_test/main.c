    /*The size of the `compressed_data` buffer being set to `MAX_DATA_SIZE * 2` is based on an assumption made when using the LZF compression algorithm.
    LZF is a fast compression algorithm, but it has the property that in rare cases, the compressed data can actually be larger than the original data.
    The maximum expansion ratio for LZF is theoretically around 104%.
    This expansion occurs in some rare cases because the LZF algorithm focuses on compression speed rather than optimal compression ratio.

    To ensure that the `compressed_data` buffer can always accommodate the compressed data, we allocate a buffer that is twice the size of the input data.
    This should be sufficient to handle the rare cases when LZF may expand the data during compression.
    Using `MAX_DATA_SIZE * 2` provides a reasonable safety margin to handle most cases without requiring dynamic memory allocation.

    In practice, you may use a buffer of size `MAX_DATA_SIZE * 2` to avoid any issues when using LZF compression, even if your specific data may not result in a large expansion.
    This is a common approach when working with LZF and similar algorithms. It ensures that your code remains robust regardless of the input data characteristics.*/
