 * Description                                                                   *
 *                                                                               *
 * The main function, panTompkings(), calls input() to get the next sample and   *
 * store it in a buffer. Then it runs through a chain of filters: DC block, low  *
 * pass @ 15 Hz and high pass @ 5Hz. The filtered signal goes both through a de- *
 * rivative filter, which output is then squared, and through a windowed-integra-*
 * tor.                                                                          *
 *                                                                               *
 * For a signal peak to be recognized as a fiducial point, its correspondent va- *
 * lue on both the filtered signal and the integrator must be above a certain    *
 * threshold. Additionally, there are time-restraints to prevent a T-wave from   *
 * being mistakenly identified as an R-peak: a hard 200ms restrain (a new peak   *
 * 200ms from the previous one is, necessarily, a T-wave) and a soft 360ms res-  *
 * train (the peak's squared slope must also be very high to be considered as a  *
 * real peak).                                                                   *
 *                                                                               *
 * When a peak candidate is discarded, its value is used to update the noise     *
 * thresholds - which are also used to estimate the peak thresholds.             *
 *                                                                               *
 * Two buffers keep 8 RR-intervals to calculate RR-averages: one of them keeps   *
 * the last 8 RR-intervals, while the other keeps only the RR-intervals that res-*
 * pect certain restrictions. If both averages are equal, the heart pace is con- *
 * sidered normal. If the heart rate isn't normal, the thresholds change to make *
 * it easier to detect possible weaker peaks. If no peak is detected for a long  *
 * period of time, the thresholds also change and the last discarded peak candi- *
 * date is reconsidered.                                                         *

 * This function is meant to do any kind of initial setup, such as starting a    *
 * serial connection with an ECG sensor. Change its parameters to whatever info  *
 * you need and its content. The test version included here loads 2 plain text   *
 * files: an input file, with the signal as a list of integer numbers in ASCII   *
 * format and an output file where either 0 or 1 will be written for each sample,*
 * whether a peak was detected or not.                                           *

 * Defines the size of the integration window. The original authors suggest on   *
 * their 1985 paper a 150ms window.                                              *

 * A value to indicate you don't have any more samples to read. Choose a value   *
 * which a sample couldn't possibly have (e.g.: a negative value if your A/D con-*
 * verter only works with positive integers).                                    *
 *                                                                               *

 * The size of the signal buffers. It should fit at least 1.66 times an RR-inter-*
 * val. Heart beats should be between 60 and 80 BPS for humans. So, considering  *
 * 1.66 times 1 second should be safe.                                           *
 *                                                                               *

 * The delay introduced to the output signal. The first DELAY samples will be ig-*
 * nored, as the filters add a delay to the output signal, causing a mismatch    *
 * between the input and output signals. It's easier to compare them this way.   *
 * If you need them both to have the same amount of samples, set this to 0. If   *
 * you're working with different filters and/or sampling rates, you might need to*
 * adjust this value.                                                            *
 *                                                                               *

 * The file, as it is, both gets its inputs and sends its outputs to files. It   *
 * works on both Windows and Linux. If your source isn't a file, and/or your sys-*
 * tem doesn't have the <stdio.h> header, remove it.                             *
 * Include any other headers you might need to make your implementation work,    *
 * such as hardware libraries provided by your microcontroller manufacturer.     *
 *                                                                               *
 * - The input() function                                                        *
 * Change it to get the next sample from your source (a file, a serial device etc*
 * previously set up in your init() function. Return the sample value or NOSAMPLE*
 * if there are no more available samples.                                       *
 *                                                                               *
 * - The output() function                                                       *
 * Change it to output whatever you see fit, however you see fit: an RR-interval *
 * (which can be sent as a parameter to your function using the RR arrays), the  *
 * index of sample or timestamp which caused a R peak, whether a sample was a R  *
 * peak or not etc, and it can be written on a file, displayed on screen, blink a*
 * LED etc.                                                                      *
 *                                                                               *
 * - The panTompkins() function                                                  *
 * This function is almost entirely ANSI C, which means it should work as is on  *
 * most platforms. The only lines you really have to change are the fclose() ones*
 * at the very end, which are only here to allow testing of the code on systems  *
 * such as Windows and Linux for PC. You may wish to create extra variables or   *
 * increase the buffers' size as you see fit to extract different kinds of infor-*
 * mation to output, or fine tune the detection as you see fit - such as adding  *
 * different conditions for verification, initializing self-updating variables   *
 * with empirically-obtained values or changing the filters.                     *
